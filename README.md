# Ocho

A minimal, production-quality Android workout interval timer, built to stay readable
when you're mid-effort and not looking at the screen.

*An **ocho** is a figure-eight step in tango. It's also Spanish for **eight**, the
round count of a classic Tabata.*

Choosing a mode, a Tabata set to the classic 4:00 of 20 seconds work and 10 seconds
rest, then the work and rest plates mid-session. The bar above Start previews the
shape of the workout before it begins.

While a session runs the plate is the entire interface, which is what makes it
readable across a room. Work and rest are separated by lightness as well as hue, so
they stay distinct with no colour vision at all. The same two screens again, with
every trace of colour removed:

## Features

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| EMOM timer | Total duration and interval length, set with drum-roll mm:ss pickers |
| Tabata timer | Total, work, and rest durations; phases alternate automatically |
| AMRAP timer | Total duration only; one unbroken block with no interval beeps |
| Phase colours | A full-screen amber, red, green, or violet plate per phase, readable across a room and distinguishable without colour vision |
| Run timeline | Proportional preview of a workout's shape before you start it |
| Sound feedback | Distinct tones per event, on the alarm stream so silent mode can't mute them |
| Vibration feedback | Different patterns for intervals and for completion |
| Pause and resume | Freeze mid-session without drift or losing interval alignment |
| Pre-start countdown | Three seconds before the first interval, to get into position |
| Presets | Save, name, load, and delete configurations, separately per mode |
| Progress and summary | A progress bar during the session, and a recap on completion |
| Exit confirmation | The back gesture and Stop both ask before ending a running session |
| In-app updates | GitHub variant checks GitHub Releases and installs updates without a store |
| Workout-first UI | Large high-contrast display, screen stays on, one-hand friendly |

## Install

Ocho has two alternative distribution channels. The [GitHub APK](https://github.com/daniel-kindl/ocho/releases/latest)
is manually installed and may require Android's unknown-app installation permission;
it retains the GitHub self-updater in Settings. The Play variant will be linked from
the [project site](https://daniel-kindl.github.io/ocho/) once its listing exists and
does not contain the GitHub self-updater.

### Update channels

| Channel | Installs as | Source | Published |
|---------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Stable | `Ocho` | `releases/latest` | On each tagged release from `main` |
| Dev | `Ocho Dev` | Newest prerelease | On every push to `dev` |

The two are separate apps with separate `applicationId`s and separate data, so a dev
build can be installed alongside the stable one and neither will offer the other's
updates. Dev builds exist to test changes before they reach `main`, so expect them
to break.

## Usage

**EMOM.** Set total duration and interval, then Start. The app beeps and vibrates at
every interval boundary. Pause freezes without drift; Stop ends early after
confirming.

**Tabata.** Set total, work, and rest. Phases alternate automatically with distinct
high and low beeps, and the whole screen switches between a dark red work plate and
a light green rest one.

**AMRAP.** Set total duration and go. Nothing interrupts you: no interval beeps, no
round counter, just the clock counting down and a 3-2-1 before it stops. Count your
own rounds.

**Presets.** Tap Save in the Presets row to store the current configuration. The
name is pre-filled from the durations, so edit it or accept it. Tap a chip to load,
or the delete control to remove it.

**Settings.** The icon on the home screen toggles sound and vibration independently,
holds the licence and privacy-policy links, and shows the GitHub updater only in the
GitHub build.

/**
 * The complete state of a running session, in one mode-agnostic shape.
 *
 * Every consumer reads this and only this: the session screens, the ongoing
 * notification, and anything added later. That is the point. Without a single type,
 * a foreground service would need to know whether it was rendering EMOM or Tabata,
 * and every future mode would mean touching the notification code again.
 *
 * Both engines map onto it, which is also the first step of collapsing the two
 * parallel session stacks into one.
 *
 * @property mode which workout produced this, for labelling only. No consumer
 *   should branch on it to decide behaviour.
 * @property status where the session is in its lifecycle.
 * @property phase what the user is doing right now.
 * @property remainingInPhaseMillis time until the phase ends. This is the dominant
 *   numeral on screen and the notification's headline.
 * @property elapsedMillis time worked, excluding time spent paused.
 * @property totalDurationMillis the configured workout length.
 * @property currentRound 1-indexed round in progress.
 * @property totalRounds rounds this workout will run.
 * @property countdownSecondsRemaining seconds left in the pre-start countdown.
 *   Meaningful only while [status] is [SessionStatus.CountingDown].

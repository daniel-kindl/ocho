/**
 * One stretch of a workout spent in a single [Phase].
 *
 * Boundaries live *inside* a segment rather than between segments, which is the one
 * decision this type turns on. An EMOM is a single twenty-minute work block that
 * beeps every minute, not twenty one-minute blocks: the athlete never stops, and the
 * timeline draws it as one bar. Modelling those beeps as segment edges would have
 * split a continuous effort into pieces that exist only in the data structure.
 *
 * @property phase what the athlete is doing for the length of this segment.
 * @property durationMillis how long it runs. Zero is allowed and deliberately not
 *   filtered out: a degenerate config still announces the phase it skips through,
 *   and dropping the segment would silently change what the engine emits.
 * @property boundaryEveryMillis spacing of interval beeps within the segment, or
 *   zero for a segment that runs unbroken. A final partial interval still beeps,
 *   which is why the count rounds up rather than down.

/**
 * The complete shape of a workout, derived once from the request that describes it.
 *
 * **This type exists to be the only answer to "what does this workout look like?"**
 * That question used to be answered five times over, in mutually mirroring code: the
 * two engines each walked their own structure, the Tabata engine walked it a second
 * time to count rounds, the setup screen walked it again to label the pickers, and
 * the run timeline walked it once more to draw the preview. Each copy carried a
 * comment promising it matched the others, which is the sort of promise that only
 * holds until someone edits one of them.
 *
 * The engines and the preview now read the same plan, so a preview that disagrees
 * with the session it previews is no longer expressible.
 *
 * @property segments the workout in running order, excluding the pre-start
 *   countdown. Never empty: every runnable configuration has at least one phase,
 *   and so does every degenerate one, which is what stops a zero-length workout
 *   from ending before it emits anything.
 * @property totalDurationMillis the configured target. Tabata can overrun it, since
 *   a phase is never cut short, so this is what progress is measured against rather
 *   than what the segments necessarily sum to.
 * @property totalRounds rounds this workout will run, or zero when rounds are not
 *   counted. An AMRAP's rounds are whatever the athlete manages, which the app has
 *   no way to know.

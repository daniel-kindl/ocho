/**
 * Owns the one workout that can be running at a time.
 *
 * **This class exists because a session must outlive the screen showing it.**
 * Previously each session view model created its own engine on `viewModelScope`,
 * which meant leaving the app could take the workout with it. The session now lives
 * in a singleton on its own scope, and the view models became observers.
 *
 * Everything here is mode-blind. It never learns whether it is running EMOM or
 * Tabata; [WorkoutEngineFactory] resolves that once and this class talks only to the
 * [WorkoutEngine] interface.
